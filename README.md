This mobile app was developed as a thesis work and it seeks to increase efficiency during the sample image acquisition stage in real-life projects related to digital image processing (DIP), which procedure is in charge of an expert in the field. The problems for this stage arise when the place of interest lacks an internet connection and is ruled by strict security protocols, for example, in underground mining. This forces the expert to only carry limited devices which creates a technology gap and leads to imprecise validation of sample images. Consequently, this can lead to the double use of logistics resources, which represents a loss of efficiency. For this reason, the current mobile app is considered as a portable computational tool
capable of applying a variaty of DIP methods, suitable control over its input mathematical parameters and offline operation. In this way, the expert will be able to pre-process the sample images simultaneously with their acquisition.
